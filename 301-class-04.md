# Class 04 notes

## Forms

- We can combine the two by making the React state be the “single source of truth”. Then the React component that renders a form also controls what happens in that form on subsequent user input.

- wait until they submit the form. that way the controlled components are always driven by the state and the user only get what they wanted

- the fefault way updates on input

** Ternary

- if an if statement is needed to be on one line or more simple

- x===y ? true : false
