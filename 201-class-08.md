## CSS Flexbox

- flex box does not allow you to stack items on eachother just picture your page as a piece of paper.

- main axis is set by direction row cross is set by column

- when making your page display in not the logical order

## Layoout

- Making all columns in a multiple-column layout adopt the same height even if they contain a different amount of content.

- It will help my pages look better and it will make it easier for me to layout my pages instead of having to wrestle CSS to get the page to look how I want.
