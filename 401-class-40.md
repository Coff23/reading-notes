## Gatsby.js

- Static Site Generation (SSG): Gatsby.js is a popular framework for building websites using the concept of Static Site Generation. It generates static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files during the build process, which can then be served directly to the browser. This approach offers several advantages, including improved performance, better security, and enhanced SEO. Teaching someone about SSG in Gatsby.js would involve explaining how Gatsby transforms data from various sources (such as Markdown files, APIs, or databases) into static pages, making the site fast and highly optimized.

- GraphQL Data Layer: Gatsby.js leverages GraphQL as its data layer, allowing developers to efficiently query and retrieve data for their websites. GraphQL provides a flexible and efficient way to fetch data from multiple sources and shape it according to specific requirements. When teaching someone about Gatsby.js, it's important to introduce them to GraphQL and demonstrate how it integrates with Gatsby's ecosystem. Showcasing how to define data sources, create GraphQL queries, and access the retrieved data in Gatsby components will enable them to leverage the power of GraphQL in their Gatsby projects.
