- What is the difference between an HTML element and a React component? Every React component has its own appearance and logic.

- Describe the process of embedding JavaScript expressions in JSX. you have to use curly braces instead of quotes

- Does React or JSX have any special features for iteration or conditional logic? There is no special syntax but there multiple ways you can write things you could use conditional logic to include JSX contitionally

- How does React know or respond to a user's inputs? event handlers are how React responds to user input

- What word indicates that a React componenet manages data with a hook? use or useState

- How can two react components share data? you will have to move state to the closest parent component of the components that you want to share the data.

## Render and Commit

- What are the three steps of refreshing a React UI? Triggering a render (delivering the guestâ€™s order to the kitchen)
Rendering the component (preparing the order in the kitchen)
Committing to the DOM (placing the order on the table)

- How do you trigger updates to a component after the initial render? react render your compnents whose state update triggered the render

- Does React recreate DOM nodes on every render? only the ones that have changed if they have not changed nothing will be done to them

- After React has updated the DOM, what still needs to happen before the user sees the change? re render
