# Introduction to React and Components

## Component-Based Architecture

- A component is a modular, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality tha encapsulates its implementation and exporting it as a higher-level interface.

- reusability, replaceable, not content specific, extensible, encapsulated, and independant

- ease of deployment, reduced cost, ease of development, reusable, modification of technical complexity, reliablity, system maintenance and evolution, and independant

## What is props and how to use it in React

- properties

- define an attribute and its value, pass it to the child component by using props, and render the props data

- unidirectional one way from the parent to the child

## Things I want to know more about

- there is plenty that I want to know but I will see how day one goes before I start asking a bunch of questions
