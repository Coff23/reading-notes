##Growth Mindset 

What it means to me is to observe learning ans if the sky is limit and not think about things that you can not do but to look at learning as you get out what you put in.

1. *Always maintain a positive attitude when learning and practicing.*
2. *Always come into class with a positive attitude and maintain that atittude through out the day.*
3. *Remember that this career path is much better than my previous career path so sticking to it and learning is worth it.*
