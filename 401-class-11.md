## Event driven programming

- What native Node.js module allows us to get started with Event Oriented Programming? EventEmitter - it allows us to get started incorporating Event-Driven Programming in our project

- What is the value of Object Oriented Programming used in tandem with Event Driven Programming? 

- Consider your knowledge of Event Driven Programming in the Web Browser, now explain to a non-technical friend how Event Driven Programming might be useful on the backend using Node.js. In order for the things on your web page to do things such as buttons events have to be triggered so that those things can do what they are intended to do.

## Additional questions

- I am most excited about learning more about event oriented programming. I feel like it is everywhere so getting better practice with it could help me in the long run I am also excited to keep learning more about DSA because that is going to be one of the main things that will help me get a job and that is the most important thing right now.

## Things I would like to know more about

- I just want to keep learning as much as I can. I am enjoying the backend stuff I just need to keep practicing
