## Review API Server Build

- Explain the difference between a query string parameter and a path parameter. Query String Parameter:
A query string parameter is a key-value pair that is appended to the end of a URL, following a question mark '?' character. Multiple query string parameters can be added by separating them with an ampersand '&' character. Path Parameter:
A path parameter, also known as a route parameter, is a variable segment within the path or URL structure itself. It is typically denoted by a placeholder surrounded by curly braces '{}'. Path parameters are used to capture dynamic values within the URL, such as IDs, usernames, or any other variable data
- What would our API URL with a path id parameter be given the following information.

Domain: http://our-site.com

v3

model name: stuff

id: things

Answer: http://our-site.com/api/v3/things

- We have created a dynamic API with an "interface" . Describe how that interface works to a non-technical friend. In the context of a dynamic API with an "interface," the interface acts as a set of instructions that tell developers how to use the API. It specifies the URLs, parameters, and data formats needed to make requests and receive responses. It's like a guidebook that helps developers interact with the API's functionality and integrate it into their own applications or services. Think of it as a clear set of rules that ensure seamless communication between different software systems.

## Review Auth Server Build

- Describe how you would use middleware to implement basic and bearer auth. Basic (username + password) to be used on the /signin route only
i.e. app.post('/signin', basicAuthentication, (req, res) => { ... })
OAuth (3rd Party) to be used on the /oauth route only
i.e. app.get('/oauth', OAuth, (req, res) => { ... })
Handles the handshake process from a 3rd party OAuth system
Bearer (token) to be used on any other route in the server that requires a logged in user
i.e. app.get('/secretstuff', tokenAuthentication, (req, res) => { ... })
- Describe the handshake necessary to implement OAuth. The OAuth processes is initiated in the browser, using a 3rd party authentication/authorization service. It will, once the user has granted permission, invoke a GET on your /oauth route. The OAuth middleware should at this point complete the handshaking process, create/update a local user account in our database, and return an object with a re-authentication/bearer token and the user object
- Describe how Role Based Access Control works to a non-technical friend. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is like organizing a party with different roles assigned to people. Each role has specific responsibilities and permissions. RBAC sets rules that determine what each role can do and where they can go, ensuring that people have the right access and limitations. It's a system that maintains security and order by controlling who can access certain areas or perform certain actions based on their assigned roles.
