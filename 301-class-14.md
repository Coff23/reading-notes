## Consider the history

- Movies like Weird Science, Revenge of the Nerds and War Games all came out in the '80s. And the plot summaries are almost interchangeable: awkward geek boy genius uses tech savvy to triumph over adversity and win the girl.

- As personal computers became more common professors assumed that their students had been playing around on computers growing up.

- Diversity efforts are most successful when theyâ€™re driven by a commitment from company leaders

- Given that diverse teams are smarter and more creative than homogeneous ones, it is unsurprising that a wealth of research shows a strong correlation between diverse organizations and positive financial outcomes

- When the employees of an organization better represent their users and desired users, they will build more effectively for those groups

## Things I would like to know more about

- I do not know what questions I have. I was in the army so I saw what it was like to make females uncomfortable at work or made so they did not really fit in and it is sickening. I have a daughter and I hope the world moves in a better direction so that my daughter is able to do whatever she wants. There are so many places that being a female and participating will get you harassed and or pushed out of the groups from places as simple as playing video games online to working in different careers that are considered for males.
