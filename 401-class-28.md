## useEffect hook

- What is the main intended use for the useEffect hook? useEffect is a React Hook that lets you synchronize a component with an external system.

- How does the effect's logic interact with the component? The useEffect hook in React allows you to perform side effects in functional components. The effect's logic interacts with the component by running after the component has rendered, and it can also run again whenever the component updates. You can use the effect to handle tasks such as fetching data, subscribing to event listeners, or modifying the DOM. Additionally, you can specify dependencies to control when the effect should run. When the component is about to be unmounted, the cleanup logic defined in the return statement of the useEffect callback will be executed. This ensures that any necessary cleanup tasks, like canceling requests or unsubscribing from listeners, are performed correctly.

- What is the importance of the return value from the effect's logic function? The return statement inside the effect's logic function serves an important purpose in the useEffect hook. It allows you to define cleanup logic that should be executed when the component is about to be unmounted or when the effect is being cleaned up due to a dependency change.

The cleanup logic is necessary to handle tasks such as canceling network requests, unsubscribing from event listeners, or any other cleanup operations that need to be performed before the component is removed from the DOM.
