- What is the first principle of Redux? is whether you apllication is a simple one or a very complex one

- What is a store and what do we use our resucers for within the store? The store in Redux is a plain JavaScript object that contains the application's state tree. It serves as a single source of truth, representing the current state of the application. The state within the store is read-only, and the only way to modify it is by dispatching actions.

Reducers, on the other hand, are functions responsible for specifying how the application's state changes in response to dispatched actions. They take the current state and an action as input and return a new state object. Reducers are pure functions that do not mutate the state directly but produce a new state based on the current state and the action received.

Within the store, reducers are used to manage and update specific portions of the application state. Each reducer typically corresponds to a specific slice or section of the state. When an action is dispatched, the store passes the current state and the action to the relevant reducer, which then determines how the state should be updated based on the action's type and payload.

By organizing state management through reducers within the store, Redux provides a predictable and centralized approach to managing application state in JavaScript applications.

- Name three Redux store methods given to us by createStore and describe their use. getState(): This method returns the current state of the Redux store. It is used to access the application state from anywhere within your application. By calling getState(), you can retrieve the current state and use it for displaying data or making decisions in your UI components or other parts of the application. dispatch(action): The dispatch method is used to dispatch actions to the Redux store. It is the primary way of triggering state changes in the store. When you call dispatch with an action object, it is sent to the appropriate reducer, which then determines how the state should be updated based on the action type and payload. subscribe(listener): The subscribe method allows you to register a listener function that will be called whenever the state in the store changes. This is useful for updating the UI or performing other side effects when the state is updated. The subscribe method returns a function that can be used to unsubscribe the listener.

- Explain to a non-technical recruiter what combineReducers() does and whu it is useful. In Redux, combineReducers() is a utility that allows you to merge multiple reducers into a single reducer function. It simplifies state management by breaking down the application's state into smaller, focused reducers. Each reducer handles a specific part of the state, promoting modularity and separation of concerns. By combining these reducers, combineReducers() creates a cohesive state structure that matches the individual reducers' structure. This approach improves code organization, readability, and maintainability in Redux applications.
