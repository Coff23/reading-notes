## Intro to nodeJS and express

- Middleware is a bridge that connects different software components so that they can exchange information.

- Express is the most popular Node framework.

- Unopinionated frameworks, by contrast, have far fewer restrictions on the best way to glue components together to achieve a goal, or even what components should be used. They make it easier for developers to use the most suitable tools to complete a particular task, albeit at the cost that you need to find those components yourself.

- A module is a javascript file that you can import into other code using nodes require() function. It allows you to organize your code into manageable parts.

## NPM

- I am running 9.6.4

- npm install jshint

## TDD

- Tests are important because if you have functions that would not pass a test then that site could have trouble deploying and there could be bugs in your code or things that do not work.

- many teams report significant reductions in defect rates, at the cost of a moderate increase in initial development effort, the same teams tend to report that these overheads are more than offset by a reduction in effort in projects’ final phases, although empirical research has so far failed to confirm this, veteran practitioners report that TDD leads to improved design qualities in the code, and more generally a higher degree of “internal” or technical quality, for instance improving the metrics of cohesion and coupling

- Individual Pitfalls: forgetting to run tests frequently, and writing too many tests at once.  Team Pitfalls: poor adoption, and poor maintenance of the test suite

## CI/CD

- Early detection of issues or bugs, constant feedback, and increased team productivity

- Continuous Delivery automates the software build, test, and packaging, making it ready for deployment, while Continuous Deployment automates the entire process, including the deployment to production, without any manual intervention.

- The process of merging changes into the main branch triggers automated tests and builds that are set up using CI tools such as Jenkins or Travis CI. These tests check if the code changes integrate smoothly with the existing codebase and ensure that the software remains functional and bug-free.

## Things I would like to know more about

- I would like to learn more about middleware because I think I might enjoy the backend more but I am not sure yet. But I suppose a question I would have to make myself think and or reflect better would be what other node frameworks are there and what benefits could they provide over express?
