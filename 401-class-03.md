# Class 03

## ES6 Classes

- Classes are a template for creating? Objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data. Classes in JS are built on prototypes but also have some syntax and semantics that are unique to classes.

- Can a class declaration be hoisted? Unlike function declarations, class declarations are not hoisted which means you can not use a class before it is declared.

- How would you describe a constructor and a contextual "this" to a non-technical friend? A constructor is declares the features your class object will have for example if you were doing vehicles you could put wheels, doors, engines etc and then you could make sub classes to define different types of vehicles like motorcycles or something. Contextual this is how you would call an attribute outside of the function that you are making so that you can use the attributes elsewhere.

## Using express routing

- Within express what does routing mean? Routing refers to how an application's endpoints responf to client requests.

- What is the difference between a route path and a route method? A route method is the code you use to declare your endpoints. A route path is kind of like a route method in the fact that requests can be made to it but it uses special characters.

- When is it appropriate to add next as a parameter to a route handler and what must you do if next has been passed to your middleware as a parameter? You would use next when you want to move on to the next endpoint without envoking an error, you must also include next() at the end of the function.

## Express Routing

- What is an Express Router? Express Routers are a way for you to organizes your app.js file so that it does not become bloated when you are declaring your endpoints.

- By what mean do we initialize express.Router() in an express server? We intialize express.Router() by importing it const router = express.Router()

- What do we use route middleware for? We use route middleware for doing something before it is processed. This could be things like checking if an user is authenticated, logging data for analytics, or anything else we would like to do before we actually spit out information to our user.

## Things I would Like to know more about

- I would like to know more about express routing in general but I suppose I am pretty interested in route path I have not seen that yet so it was pretty confusing to look at and I would like to try and work with that soon.
