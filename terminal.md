# notes

- the command line is input in the terminal that will prompt the terminal for a response in some way. for example if you want to change folders that you are in you could say cd <name of folder>

- basic navigation: in the terminal you will need to be able to get to files and or folders that you need to work out of so you will need to know basic commands to get there such as pwd tells you where you are now, ls tells you what files/folders are next, cd will bring you the the next file/folder you choose

- files this might not be interesting to everyone but I just learned that you can have spaces in your file names you just need to wrap them in quotes when you are accessing them otherwise it will take them as two commands.
