## Notes

- While going through these reading and videos the most repeated thing is in order to learn more and more is you need to put yourself outside of your comfort zone like so that you are forced to learn.

- It is also really important to understand that you are learning and not to get discouraged but to keep trying because you are still learning and you are not expected to know everything
