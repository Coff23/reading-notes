## Qusetions

### HTML Forms

- To pull data from the user or allowing them to controll th UI

- the bigger the for the more frustrating it is for the user. try and keep the form short and to the point only gathering the data you need.

- <form> = the opening tag for the form. <label> = declares what we are recieving ie emails names etc. <input> is the box that the user is gonna type in. <button> = the opening tag for the button you are trying to create. <textarea> = where the user gives the data.

### JS

- Events are what happens when when certain things happen like a chain of events like pressing a button.

- the string for the behavior ie click or mouseover, and a function to call when the event happens

- determines where the event is taking place

- capture is the opposite it fires on the least nested element and then work up.
