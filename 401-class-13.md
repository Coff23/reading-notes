## Socket.io Chat Example

- Explain to a non-technical recruiter what the Chat Example does. In this chat example there is a form made into a chat box and when a user connects to the page they are connected to the chat room and can chat in real time with other users who are also connected to the chat room and their is even a log stating that people are joining

- What proof of life are we getting on the backend from the above app? We are getting listening on port in the console and also user connected logs

- Socket.IO gives us the i0.emit() method to send an event to everyone. What flag would you use if you want to send a message to everyone except for a certain emitting socket? io.on('connection', (socket) => {
  socket.on('chat message', (msg) => {
    io.emit('chat message', msg);
  });
});

## Rooms

- What is a room and how might a room be useful? A room is an arbitrary channel that sockets can join and leave. It can be used to broadcast events to a subset of clients:

- How do you join a room? socket.join('some room') and then to broadcast to that room you would need to emit to that room and if you wanted to broadcast to multiple rooms you would just need to emit to all of the rooms at the same time.

- How do you leave a room? io.on("connection", socket => {
  socket.on("disconnecting", () => {
    console.log(socket.rooms); // the Set contains at least the socket ID
  });

  socket.on("disconnect", () => {
    // socket.rooms.size === 0
  });
});

## Namespaces

- What is a namespace and what does it allow you to do? A Namespace is a communication channel that allows you to split the logic of your application over a single shared connection (also called "multiplexing").

- Each namespace potentially has its own what? event handler, rooms, and middleware

- Duscuss a possible use case for seperate namespaces. If you wanted to create a room for each team in a multiplayer game so that they can talk strategy and the other team would not see it and also have a room the whole lobby can see so you can talk trash to eachother or something.

## Things I would like to know more about

- I would like to get more into this socket.io thing as a whole I am super interested in the idea of making games so socket.io should be something that I should really familiarize myself with.
