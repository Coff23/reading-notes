## AWS API Gateway Overview

- What is Amazon API Gateway? Amazon API Gateway is a managed service that allows developers to define the HTTP endpoints of a REST API or a WebSocket API and connect those endpoints with the corresponding backend business logic. It also handles authentication, access control, monitoring, and tracing of API requests.

- Why is Amazon API Gateway an important part of the Serverless ecosystem? Within the Serverless ecosystem, API Gateway is the piece that ties together Serverless functions and API definitions. Being able to trigger the execution of a Serverless function directly in response to an HTTP request is the key reason why API Gateway is so valuable in Serverless setups: it enables a truly serverless architecture for web applications. When using API Gateway together with other AWS services, it’s possible to build a fully functional customer-facing web application without maintaining a single server yourself.

- How does API Gateway integrate with other AWS services? Many AWS services support integration with Amazon API Gateway, including:

AWS Lambda: run Lambda functions to generate HTTP API responses.
AWS SNS: publish SNS notifications when an HTTP API endpoint is accessed.
Amazon Cognito: provide authentication and authorization for your HTTP APIs.
API Gateway supports direct integrations that can be configured in the API Gateway user interface (or via the API Gateway’s own API) for the following actions:

Invoking an AWS Lambda function.
Invoking another HTTP endpoint, with or without VPC Link.
Making an HTTP call against the API of any AWS service that provides an HTTP API.
Returning a mock response generated within API Gateway without calling out to other services.

## AWS API Gateway

- What are the some benefits of using Amazon API Gateway? Amazon API Gateway is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale. APIs act as the "front door" for applications to access data, business logic, or functionality from your backend services. Using API Gateway, you can create RESTful APIs and WebSocket APIs that enable real-time two-way communication applications. API Gateway supports containerized and serverless workloads, as well as web applications.

API Gateway handles all the tasks involved in accepting and processing up to hundreds of thousands of concurrent API calls, including traffic management, CORS support, authorization and access control, throttling, monitoring, and API version management. API Gateway has no minimum fees or startup costs. You pay for the API calls you receive and the amount of data transferred out and, with the API Gateway tiered pricing model, you can reduce your cost as your API usage scales.

- What two API types might you chooses from? RESTful and websocket

## AWS DynamoDB Guide

- What is DynamoDB? DynamoDB is a hosted NoSQL database offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It offers:

reliable performance even as it scales;
a managed experience, so you won't be SSH-ing into servers to upgrade the crypto libraries;
a small, simple API allowing for simple key-value access as well as more advanced query patterns.

- Under what circumstances would you recommend DynamoDB over MongoDB? If you are building a serverless application using AWS Lambda or similar services, DynamoDB integrates seamlessly with these platforms. It provides a native integration that allows you to trigger functions based on database events, making it a convenient choice for serverless architectures.

## AWS DynamoDB

- Explain to a non-technical friend how DynamoDB works. DynamoDB is a smart and efficient database that stores data in tables, like sections in a notebook. It can handle a lot of data and many people accessing it at once. You can add, update, and remove information easily. You find data using keys, like page numbers in a notebook, or by searching for specific attributes. DynamoDB is managed by Amazon Web Services (AWS), so you don't have to worry about the technical stuff. It's like a powerful notebook that stores and organizes data for you.

## Dynamoose

- What is Dynamoose? Dynamoose is a modeling tool for Amazon's DynamoDB. Dynamoose is heavily inspired by Mongoose, which means if you are coming from Mongoose the syntax will be very familiar.

What are some key features of Dynamoose? Type safety
High level API
Easy to use syntax
DynamoDB Single Table Design Support
Ability to transform data before saving or retrieving items
Strict data modeling (validation, required attributes, and more)
Support for DynamoDB Transactions
Powerful Conditional/Filtering Support
Callback & Promise support
AWS Multi-region support

## Things I would like to know more about

- I still need to figure what we have been working on with AWS like lambda so I do not know if I have any questions right now.
