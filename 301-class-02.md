# Class 03

## React lifecycle

- render

- mounting

- constructor, render, componentdidmount, react Updates, and componentWillUnmount

- it loads anything using a network request or initializes the DOM

## React State VS Props

- components relevant to the function that you are making

- state is hanndled inside the component and can be changed inside props handeled outside the component and changed outside the component

- you re-render when after you store something in state

- you would store things in state that are changing such as personal info like name or title so that we can re-render thew page to be for the user. 

## Thing I would like to know

- I know we have only had one class but so far nothing makes sense to me. I am hoping that today helps things make a little bit more sense.
