## Questions

### Domain Modeling

- if articulated well can express a strong understanding of problems

### HTML Table Basics

- Layout tables reduce accessibility for visually impaired users, Tables produce tag soup, and Tables are not automatically responsive.

- table data "<td></td>", table row "<tr></tr>", table header "<th></th>", and colspan/rowspan (spans out the column or row)

### Introducing Constructors

- you can prevent youself from having to write code over and over again for every object.

- you use this in the onject to refer to this in your constructor.

### Object Prototypes Using A Constructor

- I think this might work. So at work we would train people on different tasks so that they were subject matter experts on that task and when we would get a new soldier they would different things from everyone. new soldiers were objects, existing soldiers were functions. in my head this makes sense but when I read it it sounds weird.

## Thing I want to know more about

- I want to learn more about the functions for objects. last night I got pretty stuck so I am going to do more research.
