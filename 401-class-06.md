## Securing Passwords

- Explain to a non-technical friend how you would safely hash and store a password. You could slow down the attack by using something like bcrypt which will add a security factor to your password

- What is Bcrypt? Bcrypt is an adaptive hash function based on the Blowfish symmetric block cipher cryptographic algorithm and introduces a work factor (also known as security factor), which allows you to determine how expensive the hash function will be.

- Why might you use something like Bcrypt? This work factor value determines how slow the hash function will be, means different work factor will generate different hash values in different time span, which makes it extremely resistant to brute force attacks. When computers become faster next year we can increase the work factor to balance it out i.e. to make the attack slower.

## Basic Auth

- What is basic Authentication? In the context of an HTTP transaction, basic access authentication is a method for an HTTP user agent (e.g. a web browser) to provide a user name and password when making a request. In basic HTTP authentication, a request contains a header field in the form of Authorization: Basic credentials, where credentials is the Base64 encoding of ID and password joined by a single colon :

- What properties are necessary in the header of a Basic Auth request? Authorization: Basic credentials, where credentials is the Base64 encoding of ID and password joined by a single colon :

- How are username:password in Basic Auth encoded? The username and password are combined with a single colon (:). This means that the username itself cannot contain a colon.
The resulting string is encoded into an octet sequence. The character set to use for this encoding is by default unspecified, as long as it is compatible with US-ASCII, but the server may suggest use of UTF-8 by sending the charset parameter.[9]
The resulting string is encoded using a variant of Base64 (+/ and with padding).
The authorization method and a space character (e.g. "Basic ") is then prepended to the encoded string.
For example, if the browser uses Aladdin as the username and open sesame as the password, then the field's value is the Base64 encoding of Aladdin:open sesame, or QWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuIHNlc2FtZQ==. Then the Authorization header field will appear as:

Authorization: Basic QWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuIHNlc2FtZQ==

## OWASP Auth Cheat Sheet

- Define the authentication process to a non-technical recruiter. Authentication is the process of making sure someone is who they say they are using an username and some private information that only the user should know.

- How should your error messaging respond (both HTTP and HTML)? Why? should log generic errors whether the user ID was incorrect, the account does not exist, or the account is locked or disabled. This way you can prevent an attacker from mounting an user enumeration action against the application.

- Bookmark this link also and consider OWASP fundamentals any time you interact with authentication. Applications developed with security in mind from inception have fewer vulnerablities throughout their lifecycle.

## Additional Questions

- I look forward to learning more about Authentication because I am enjoying backend stuff. And getting good at the backend is something that I am interested in.

- To just keep learning as much as I can and using all of the resources that this school has to offer.
