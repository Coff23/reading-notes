## Thinking in React

- Summarize the five steps to thinking in React. Break the UI into a component hierarchy, Build a static version in React, Find the minimal but complete representation of UI state, identify where your state should live, Add inverse data flow.

## Stata: A Components Memory

- What is one reason a local variable isn't sufficient for managing a React componenent? Local variables don’t persist between renders. When React renders this component a second time, it renders it from scratch—it doesn’t consider any changes to the local variables.
Changes to local variables won’t trigger renders. React doesn’t realize it needs to render the component again with the new data.

- What is the argument to the useState hook, and what are the two parts of its return array? A state variable to retain the data between renders.
A state setter function to update the variable and trigger React to render the component again.

- How can Compnenet A access state from Component B? state can be shared as long as it is being passed down from a parent component to its children.
