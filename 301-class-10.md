## JavaScript error messages

- This is as simple as when you try to use a variable that is not yet declared you get this type os errors.

- when you have something that cannot be parsed in terms of syntax

- Try to manipulate an object with some kind of length and give it an invalid length and this kind of errors will show up.

- accessing a property in an undefined type of variable.

- will make your program stop at that point only if a condition is met

- If the line you selected was run you will be able to see what has happened before that point and you can try and evaluate the next lines to check if everything is outputting what you are expecting.
