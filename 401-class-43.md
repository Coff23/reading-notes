## getting started with react native

- Name three Core Components of React Native and describe what they do. View: The View component is similar to the <div> element in HTML. It is used to create a container for other components or to group multiple components together. Views are used to structure and layout the user interface.

Text: The Text component is used to display text content in the app. It is similar to the <span> or <p> elements in HTML. You can use the Text component to render headings, paragraphs, labels, and other textual content.

Image: The Image component is used to display images in the app. It provides a way to load and render both local and remote images. You can specify the image source, dimensions, and other properties to control how the image is displayed.

- What problem does React Native solve (why call it native)? React Native is called "native" because it allows developers to build mobile apps that can run natively on multiple platforms, such as iOS and Android, using a single codebase. It solves the problem of having to develop separate codebases for each platform, which can be time-consuming and require different programming languages and frameworks.

The main problem that React Native addresses is the need for cross-platform development. Traditionally, building native mobile apps for iOS and Android requires developers to use different programming languages (Objective-C or Swift for iOS, and Java or Kotlin for Android) and separate development environments. This means that developers need to write and maintain two separate codebases, which can lead to increased development time, effort, and cost.

React Native simplifies this process by allowing developers to write mobile app code in JavaScript, which is a widely-used and accessible programming language. With React Native, developers can create a single codebase that can be shared between iOS and Android platforms, reducing the need for duplicating efforts and maintaining separate codebases.

Under the hood, React Native uses native components that are rendered by the underlying native platform. This means that the user interface components in React Native are not just web views or HTML elements, but actual native components that provide a native look and feel. This approach allows React Native apps to achieve high performance and a native user experience, comparable to apps built using traditional native development methods.

- What are the building blocks of a React Native app? How does that compare to a React app? Components: Components are the fundamental building blocks of both React and React Native applications. They are reusable and self-contained units of code that encapsulate a specific piece of functionality and user interface. React Native provides a set of pre-built components such as View, Text, Image, TextInput, etc., which are similar to HTML elements. However, React Native components render native UI elements instead of HTML elements.

JSX: JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension used in both React and React Native. It allows developers to write XML-like syntax within JavaScript code, making it easier to define the structure and layout of the user interface. JSX enables developers to write declarative UI code, which describes what the UI should look like based on the current application state.

State and Props: React Native, like React, utilizes the concepts of state and props to manage data and pass information between components. State represents the internal data of a component that can change over time, while props (short for properties) are used to pass data from parent components to child components. By managing state and props, React Native apps can dynamically update their UI based on user interactions and data changes.

Styling: React Native uses a combination of JavaScript and CSS-like stylesheets to define the appearance of components. Styles can be applied inline using JavaScript objects or defined in external stylesheets. The styling system in React Native is similar to CSS but uses a subset of CSS properties and values. React Native also provides Flexbox layout support, which is a powerful and flexible layout system for arranging components.

While the building blocks of React Native and React are similar, there are some key differences due to the platform-specific nature of React Native. React Native incorporates native UI components and APIs, allowing it to interface with the underlying platform's features. This enables React Native to provide a more native-like experience compared to React, which primarily targets web browsers. Additionally, React Native introduces components specific to mobile development, such as those related to navigation, gestures, and handling platform-specific behaviors.

## expo

- What solution does expo provide? Expo is a free and open-source platform that provides a set of tools and services for developing and building React Native applications. It aims to simplify the process of developing, testing, and deploying React Native apps by providing a unified development environment and additional features.

- Expo tries to manage as much of the complexity of building apps as possible, which is why we call it the ____ workflow. managed

- What is the difference between React Native and Expo? Core Technology:

React Native: React Native is an open-source framework developed by Facebook that allows developers to build native mobile apps using JavaScript and React. It provides a set of pre-built components and APIs that render to native UI components on iOS and Android.
Expo: Expo is a platform built on top of React Native that provides additional tools, services, and a higher-level development environment for building React Native apps. It simplifies the development process and abstracts away some of the complexities involved in configuring and building React Native apps.
Development Workflow:

React Native: React Native offers two main development workflows: the "Managed" workflow and the "Bare" workflow. In the Managed workflow, you develop your app using Expo's tools and services, which handle many aspects of the development process. In the Bare workflow, you have more control and access to the native code, allowing for deeper customization but also requiring more configuration and maintenance.
Expo: Expo primarily supports the Managed workflow. It provides a unified development environment, including a CLI, tools, and services, to simplify the development and deployment process. Expo abstracts away some of the native code configuration and build complexities, allowing developers to focus more on writing JavaScript code.

## expo snack

- checkout this too. What does snack allow you to do? Snack is an online platform provided by Expo that allows you to experiment, prototype, and test React Native code directly in your web browser. It provides a web-based development environment where you can write, preview, and share React Native code without requiring any local setup or installation.

## ejecting

- What does “eject” mean within the context of Expo? ejecting is when you leave the workfolw of an expo app

- When should you not eject? Rapid Prototyping and Small Projects: If you are working on a small project or need to quickly prototype an idea, sticking with the managed workflow can be beneficial. Expo's managed workflow provides a streamlined development experience with minimal configuration, allowing you to focus on writing code and iterating quickly.

Limited Native Code Requirements: If your app's functionality can be achieved using Expo's pre-built APIs and components without requiring extensive customization or integration with platform-specific native code, there may be no need to eject. Expo's SDK provides a wide range of native APIs that cover common use cases, such as camera access, push notifications, and geolocation.

Avoiding Complex Native Build Configuration: Ejecting from the managed workflow gives you more control over the native code and allows for deeper customization. However, it also introduces additional complexity, especially in terms of configuring and managing native build processes. If you want to avoid dealing with the complexities of setting up and maintaining native build configurations, sticking with the managed workflow can be a viable option.

Over-the-Air Updates: Expo's managed workflow includes a convenient feature called over-the-air (OTA) updates. This allows you to push updates to your app without requiring users to download a new version from an app store. If your app frequently requires updates or content changes that can be delivered through OTA updates, avoiding ejecting can be beneficial as it simplifies the update process.

Limited Platform-Specific Requirements: If your app doesn't have specific platform requirements that can only be achieved through native code integration or customization, such as deep integration with specific native libraries or access to advanced platform-specific features, then the managed workflow may be sufficient.

- Why might you choose to eject? Custom Native Code: If your app requires extensive integration with specific native libraries or custom native modules that are not available through Expo's pre-built APIs, ejecting allows you to directly access and modify the native code of your iOS and Android projects. This gives you the flexibility to incorporate platform-specific functionalities or use third-party native libraries that are not supported by Expo.

Advanced Configuration and Customization: Ejecting provides more control over the build configuration and allows for deeper customization. If your app requires fine-grained control over native modules, build settings, third-party library integrations, or access to lower-level platform-specific features, ejecting gives you the flexibility to make the necessary modifications to meet your specific requirements.

Performance Optimization: In some cases, you may need to optimize the performance of your app by fine-tuning native code, implementing custom UI components, or utilizing platform-specific optimizations. Ejecting allows you to directly optimize the native codebase, potentially improving the performance of your app beyond what is achievable in the Expo managed workflow.

Platform-Specific Integrations: If your app requires deep integration with platform-specific features or APIs that are not provided by Expo, such as integrations with specific hardware components, advanced audio/video processing, or advanced network configurations, ejecting allows you to access and leverage those platform-specific capabilities.

Access to New React Native Features: In some cases, you may want to use new features or capabilities introduced in the latest version of React Native that are not yet supported by Expo. By ejecting, you have the flexibility to upgrade your project to the latest version of React Native and take advantage of new features and improvements.
