## Thinking in react

- a component should only do one thing and if it starts to grow it needs to be broken down.

- If I am reading this right a static version would be the version before you add interactivity. So you would not need state.

- user interactivity

- Does it remain unchanged over time? If so, it isn’t state. Is it passed in from a parent via props? If so, it isn’t state Can you compute it based on existing state or props in your component? If so, it definitely isn’t state!

- Identify every component that renders something based on that state. Find their closest common parent component—a component above them all in the hierarchy. Decide where the state should live: Often, you can put the state directly into their common parent. You can also put the state into some component above their common parent. If you can’t find a component where it makes sense to own the state, create a new component solely for holding the state and add it somewhere in the hierarchy above the common parent component.

## Higher-Order Functions

- functions that operate on other functions

- it is setting m to be greater than or equal to whatever n is predetermined to be.

- they take an array and can modify them or just take single components
