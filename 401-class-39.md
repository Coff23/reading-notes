## Redux Tooklkit

- What concerns are addressed by Redux toolkit?"Configuring a Redux store is too complicated"
"I have to add a lot of packages to get Redux to do anything useful"
"Redux requires too much boilerplate code"

- What does configureStore() do?  wraps createStore to provide simplified configuration options and good defaults. It can automatically combine your slice reducers, adds whatever Redux middleware you supply, includes redux-thunk by default, and enables use of the Redux DevTools Extension.

- How would I use createSlice()? accepts an object of reducer functions, a slice name, and an initial state value, and automatically generates a slice reducer with corresponding action creators and action types.

## MobX

- What is MobX? a simple, scalable and battle tested state management solution. This tutorial will teach you all the important concepts of MobX in ten minutes. MobX is a standalone library, but most people are using it with React and this tutorial focuses on that combination.

- How does MobX make it "impossible" to produce an inconsistant state?  Make sure that everything that can be derived from the application state, will be derived. Automatically.

- How would we build a reactive user interface? React components are (despite their name) not reactive out of the box. The observer HoC wrapper from the mobx-react-lite package fixes that by basically wrapping the React component in autorun. This keeps the component in sync with the state. This is conceptually not different from what we did with the report before.

The next listing defines a few React components. The only MobX specific code in there is the observer wrapping. That is enough to make sure that each component individually re-renders when relevant data changes. We don't have to call state useState setters anymore, nor do we have to figure out how to subscribe to the proper parts of the application state using selectors or higher order components that need configuration. Basically, all components have become smart. Yet they are defined in a dumb, declarative manner.
