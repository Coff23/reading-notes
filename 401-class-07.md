## JWT

- What is a JSON Web Token? JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA.

- When should we use a JSON Web Token? Authorization is the most common scenario that we use them. Information Exchange is another time.

- Claims are expected in which structural component of a JWT? The payload

## Are JWTs secure

- If I get a JWT and I can decode the payload, how can we call that secure? If a token is signed but not encrypted anyone can read it

- If sending a JWT, what must sender and reciever both know?  the secret key

- Explain how concatenated content and secret can be sent and revieved sucurely to a non-technical friend. hash will encrypt anything in the () so that no one can read it unless they know the secret

## JWT Explained

- Why use JWT? to securely transfer information between two bodies.

- JWT is Compact and self-contained. Describe how this is useful to a non-technical friend. because of how compact it is it makes it more useable and fast. and that one token has everything in it

- What are the three components of a JWT signature? header, payload, and signature.

## Things I would like to know more about

- I would like to know more about using JWT but I assume we are going to go over this in class today
