## 5 steps to RBAC

- What is a role based access control and why do we care? RBAC is the idea of assigning system access to users based on their role within an organization. With proper roles and permissions system management gets much easier.

- Describe a role/permission heirarchy that you might implement using RBAC. A role/permission heirarchy I might implement on a site would be basic access to view site, some access to change your own information as long as you have made an account, and full access to do anything if you own the site. Somewhere in there I would also add an admin role in case people needed help with their accounts this is all dependant on the type of site that this would be though. So viewer, user, admin, and sole owner.

- What approach might you take to implement RBAC? Inventory your systems, Analyze your work force and create roles, Assign people to roles, Never make one-off changes, and Audit.
