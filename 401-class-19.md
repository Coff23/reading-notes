## AWS SQS vs SNS

- What is the difference between SQS and SNS? SNS is a distributed publish-subscribe service. SQS is distributed queuing service. SQS : Pull Mechanism — Consumers poll messages from SQS. SNS : Push Mechanism — SNS pushes messages to consumers.

- What are some use cases for both SQS and SNS? Choose SNS if:

You would like to be able to publish and consume batches of messages.
You would like to allow same message to be processed in multiple ways.
Multiple subscribers are needed.
Choose SQS if:

You need a simple queue with no particular additional requirements.
Decoupling two applications and allowing parallel asynchronous processing.
Only one subscriber is needed.

## AWS SNS and SQS

- Describe how to use SQS and SNS in a "fanout" pattern. publishing a message to many subscribers

- Explain how "push notifications" work, using SNS. Set up a Topic: Create a communication channel called a topic in SNS.

Create Subscriptions: Subscribe endpoints (devices or services) to the topic to receive push notifications.

Configure Platforms: Configure specific platforms (e.g., iOS, Android) for mobile notifications.

Publish a Message: Send a message to the topic with the notification content.

SNS Notification Process: SNS routes the message to the appropriate push notification service based on the platform.

Delivery to Subscribers: The push notification service delivers the notification to the subscribed devices or endpoints.

## SQS and SNS Basics

- How might a large scale, distributed application make use of a queue system like SQS? Decoupling Components: SQS allows independent development and fault tolerance by decoupling components through message queues.

Load Leveling: SQS handles varying workloads efficiently by storing messages in queues, enabling load leveling.

Asynchronous Processing: SQS enables asynchronous processing, allowing tasks to be offloaded to the queue for independent worker processing.

Fault Tolerance: SQS provides a highly available and durable message queue, ensuring message persistence and system resilience.

Scalability: SQS supports horizontal scaling by allowing multiple workers to process messages concurrently.

Prioritization and Ordering: SQS offers message prioritization and FIFO queues for managing message order.

Distributed Architecture: SQS facilitates inter-service communication in distributed architectures.
