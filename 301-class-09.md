## Functional programming concepts

- Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data — Wikipedia

- It returns the same result if given the same arguments, It does not cause any observable side effects

- The code’s definitely easier to test. We don’t need to mock anything. So we can unit test pure functions with different contexts:

- Unchanging over time or unable to be changed.

- Passing 2 as a parameter of the square function will always returns 4. So now we can replace the square(2) with 4. That's it! Our function is referentially transparent

- code split up by functionality that you all upon when you need them

- require is kind of like importing

- require

- you have to say what part of the module you want to allow to be used with module.exports
