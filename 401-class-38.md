## async actions

- Why use Redux middleware? Middleware also have access to dispatch and getState. That means you could write some async logic in a middleware, and still have the ability to interact with the Redux store by dispatching actions.

- Consider the Redux Async Data Flow Diagram. Describe the flow in your own words. it works the same as a regular action we just need to handle the action first and then we can dispatch and pass something

- How are we accommodating async in our Redux app? by using redux-thunk

## thunk kmiddleware

- Why would you need redux-thunk middleware? it extends the stores abilities and lets you write async logic that interacts with the store

- Redux Thunk middleware allows you to write action creators that return a ____ instead of an action. function

- Describe how any return value from the inner thunk function will be made available. it will be available as the return value of the dispatch itself
