## Passing Functions as Props

- a new array with the same length as the parent array

-   const listItems = numbers.map((number) =>
    <li>{number}</li>
  );
  return (
    <ul>{listItems}</ul>

- key

- keys help react identify which itmes have changed, are added, or are removed.

## The spread operator

- the spread operator is a useful and quick syntax for adding items to arrays, combining arrays, and spreading an array out into a functions argument.

- copying an array, using math functions, combining objects, and adding an item to a list

- "const combineArray = [...arrayOne,...arrayTwo]"

- [1, 2, ...oldArray]

- {...objectOne, ...objectTwo}

## Video

- passes the state as the argument in the increment function

- maps through the list of people and if they match then it adds one to their counter

- you call the method ex this.props.increment()

### Thing I want to know more about

- Im still a little confused on key. For example on lab 02 I had to add a key to my images because I was getting an error but even after I added it the error is still there.
