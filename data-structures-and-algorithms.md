# Data Structures and Algorithms

## What is one of the most important things to consider when deciding which alogorithm to use?

We need to understand what we need to do and what we want the outcome to be. Understanding this will better help us understand what algorithm we need to go with per problem.

## How can we ensure that we will avoid an infinite loop in recursive stack?

You have to tell the recursive function when to stop that is why every recursive function has two parts the base case and the recursive case.

## Things I want to know more about

- I would like to just keep diving into all of this but I suppose if I had to pick one thing as a question right now it would be when is a for loop better than a recursive loop and what makes it better?
